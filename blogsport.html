<br>
<br>In chaos theory, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">butterfly effect</span> is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in
which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large
differences in a later state.
The term is closely associated with the work of mathematician and meteorologist
Edward Lorenz. He noted that butterfly effect is derived from the metaphorical example
of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being
influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several
weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed runs of his
weather model with initial condition data that were rounded in a seemingly
inconsequential manner. He noted that the weather model would fail to reproduce the
results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial
conditions had created a significantly different outcome.

<br>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flying Dutchman</span> (Dutch: De Vliegende Hollander) is a legendary ghost ship which
was said to never be able to make port, doomed to sail the oceans forever. The myth is
likely to have originated from the 17th-century Golden Age of the Dutch East India
Company (VOC) and Dutch maritime power. The oldest extant version of
the legend has been dated to the late 18th century. According to the legend, if hailed by
another ship, the crew of the Flying Dutchman was said to try to send messages to land,
or to people long dead. Purported sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries claimed that
the ship glowed with a ghostly light. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is
a portent of doom.
The first print reference to the ship appears in Travels in various part of Europe, Asia and
Africa during a series of thirty years and upward (1790) by John MacDonald:
<span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 14px;">"The weather was so stormy that the sailors said they saw the Flying
Dutchman. The common story is that this Dutchman came to the Cape in
distress of weather and wanted to get into harbour but could not get a pilot to
conduct her and was lost and that ever since in very bad weather her vision
appears."</span>

Natural Radio Emission in Venus’
Atmosphere.</span>
<br>During a brief swing by Venus, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe detected a natural
radio signal that revealed the spacecraft had flown through the planet’s upper
atmosphere. This was the first direct measurement of the Venusian
atmosphere in nearly 30 years — and it looks quite different from Venus past.
A study published today confirms that Venus’ upper atmosphere undergoes
puzzling changes over a solar cycle, the Sun’s 11-year activity cycle. Thismarks the latest clue to untangling how and why Venus and Earth are so
different.
Born of similar processes, Earth and Venus are twins: both rocky, and of
similar size and structure. But their paths diverged from birth. Venus lacks a
magnetic field, and its surface broils at temperatures hot enough to melt lead.
At most, spacecraft have only ever survived a couple hours there. Studying
Venus, inhospitable as it is, helps scientists understand how these twins have
evolved, and what makes Earth-like planets habitable or not.
On July 11, 2020, Parker Solar Probe swung by Venus in its third flyby. Each
flyby is designed to leverage the planet’s gravity to fly the spacecraft closer
and closer to the Sun. The mission — managed by Johns Hopkins Applied
Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland — made its closest flyby of Venus yet,
passing just 517 miles (833 km) above the surface.
