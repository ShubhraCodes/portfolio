<p class="go">General Overview</p>
<p class="godes">
    I write, I design and sometimes I make music. Actually web design is constructed based on one's passion over it,
    <br>Just like songwriting or composing a piece. At the beginning of my college life i was introduced to different
    <br>Programming Languages. It was nothing but a mess to me back then, but gradually I've grown the interest.
    <br>It fascinates me in multiple ways. First of all I was very keen of editing, designing since beginning and
    <br>Also you've nothing to memorize in this field, Regular practice will do the key job for you.
    <br>In music, I was taught to have patience and so in coding.
    <br>I personally believe that Passion has no boundaries and also it is something
    <br>That will never make you sit for refreshment.
